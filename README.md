CryptoNotify
============

###ABOUT###



CryptoNotify is a desktop application that alerts the user to a completed filled order on the Bittrex Exchange.

###LATEST VERSION###


The current version is v0.9-beta.2
Binaries can be found here https://github.com/JJ12880/CryptoNotify/releases
Sources can be found here  https://github.com/JJ12880/CryptoNotify



###INSTALLATION###


No installation necessary. CryptoNotify was designed to run from a single .exe file for speed and ease of use. 
CryptoNotify.exe will generate all the resources it needs at runtime. 




###REQUIREMENTS###


CryptoNotify works by monitoring your account using the private API provided by Bittrex. In order to do this, the 
program will need a set of working read-only API keys. API keys are specified in the settings menu. To get or  
generate a set of API keys, go to "Settings" and then "API Keys" in the upper right hand corner of the Bittrex Website. 
Turn off all options other than "Read Info". CryptoNotify does not send your API keys anywhere or transmit them
in any fashion. Without a working set of API keys, CryptoNotify will not function. 



###FEATURES###


Fully configurable notification options allow you to be alerted via:

+ Popup window on the desktop
+ System tray message
+ Sound alert
+ Email
+ Text from Email 
+ Simple user interface with connection status information
+ Minimizes to the system tray so you can set and forget. 

You can select one, two, or all options in any combination that suits your needs. 

NOTE: Cryptonotify does not generate alerts for partial orders. Support for partial orders will be added in the next version. 

CAUTION:  Email and Email to SMS features are not completely secure, and the developer will theoretically have access
to your Email address or cellular number. This information is not exposed to other users.


###PLANNED FEATURES###


+ Add Support for partial trades
+ Support for sending alerts from user specified email account via POP or SMTP servers.
