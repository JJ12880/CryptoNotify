###INSTALLATION###


No installation necessary. CryptoNotify was designed to run from a single .exe file for speed and ease of use. 
CryptoNotify.exe will generate all the resources it needs at runtime. 




###REQUIREMENTS###


CryptoNotify works by monitoring your account using the private API provided by Bittrex. In order to do this, the 
program will need a set of working read-only API keys. API keys are specified in the settings menu. To get or  
generate a set of API keys, go to "Settings" and then "API Keys" in the upper right hand corner of the Bittrex Website. 
Turn off all options other than "Read Info". CryptoNotify does not send your API keys anywhere or transmit them
in any fashion. Without a working set of API keys, CryptoNotify will not function. 



###FEATURES###


Fully configurable notification options allow you to be alerted via:


+ Popup window on the desktop
+ System tray message
+ Sound alert
+ Simple user interface with connection status information
+ Minimizes to the system tray so you can set and forget. 

NEW

+ Alerts will now be generated for partial trades!

  
You can select one, two, or all options in any combination that suits your needs. 

###PLANNED FEATURES###


+ Support for sending alerts from user specified email account via POP or SMTP servers.
